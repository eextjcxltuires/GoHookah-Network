# GoHookah-Network.

This application was written in the studio. Initially, it was as an application for an internship, where they could evaluate my knowledge. Subsequently, when they saw, that I could write the application, they found investors, and the application went from a test version to a commercial one.

After, I left the studio, had limited access to the previously written and did not have the source code. In this repository I am trying to at least some part of the past application, but without affecting the copyrights.

## Getting Started.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

How do I start it up?

```

IDE VS Code:
